**VHDL-Fulladder_display**

This is a hardware description for a fulladder with a four digit 7-segment display written in VHDL. The repo was originally created to store my school assignment but I also figured someone else might have a use for this.


The software used for this project is Vivado 2014.3 and the configuration is made for the basys 3(Artix 7 FPGA) development board.

The source files are located in [projectname].srcs/sources.

You may use the source files in your own project or use the project itself as you see fit.

**Specifications** 

This project also includes a binary to BCD converter and a BCD to 7-segment decoder.
